# Install Framer Motion

To enable the smooth zoom/bulge animations for workout tiles, you need to install Framer Motion:

```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

After installation, the WorkoutTile component will use Framer Motion's `layoutId` for smooth transitions when expanding/collapsing workout tiles.
